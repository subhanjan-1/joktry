PROBLEM 1
Most of the world will make
decisions by either guessing or

using their gut. They will be either
lucky or wrong.



PROBLEM 2
Companies on mobile & web are
measuring bullshit metrics like

page views and installs. It’s really
hard to be really sophisticated.



SOLUTION
Mixpanel has built analytics software
for product and marketing. As we

continue to penetrate organizations,
we will build software for sales and
finance next.



MISSION

Help the world learn from its data.



COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
In 2010, we built the most
sophisticated analytics database

engine to answer questions that
existing technology could not
answer. It’s the reason we are
winning.
